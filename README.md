MQTT Sample Project
===================

This is a simple symfony project to show how we can implement a MQTT publisher.

The goal of this project is creating an API to add a new student to database.
Then after saving it in databse, we will publish the infromation of the new student to our MQTT broker.

First you should run `docker-composer up -d`
